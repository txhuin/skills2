"""Hackbright Skills 2: Python Data Structures.

There are a bunch of functions in this file that are not written, but
have documentation strings that explain how they should work. Your job
is to edit this file to write the bodies of these functions.

We expect that you will solve these problems using Python lists
and dictionaries. Some of these problems could be solved with Python
sets (a more advanced data type); if you've learned about sets, you
may use these here.

This file uses "doctests"; the explanation of how the functions should
work contains examples just like you'd see in the Python interpreter.
The examples are actually run and tested when this file is ran.

When you first run this test, it will show test failures for every
function--since the real functions haven't been written yet. As you
write the real functions, your test failure count will go down.

At the point where you've completed this skills assessment, the
only output from this program would be:

   ** ALL TESTS PASSED. GOOD WORK!

Good luck!

def count_unique(string1):
    """Count unique words in a string.

    This function should take a single string and return a dictionary
    that has all of the distinct words as keys, and the number of times
    that word appears in the string.


    For example:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("each word appears once"))
        {'appears': 1, 'each': 1, 'once': 1, 'word': 1}
  
    Words that appear more than once should be counted each time:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("rose is a rose is a rose"))
        {'a': 2, 'is': 2, 'rose': 3}

    It's fine to consider punctuation part of a word (e.g., a comma
    at the end of a word can be counted as part of that word) and
    to consider differently-capitalized words as different:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("Porcupine see, porcupine do."))
        {'Porcupine': 1, 'do.': 1, 'porcupine': 1, 'see,': 1}
